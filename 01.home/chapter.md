# Maniaplanet Support

The Maniaplanet documentation website is created to help using the tools of the Maniaplanet game operating system. This site will describe how to do several things, such as:

* [Setup a dedicated server](/dedicated-server/getting-started)
* [How to setup a MatchMaking infrastructure](/dedicated-server/matchmaking)
* Using the different tools of Maniaplanet like the [ActionMaker](/actionmaker), the [importer](/nadeo-importer/getting-started) and more.
* Learn to code a [Manialink](/manialink/getting-started) and to learn the [ManiaScript language](/maniascript/syntax-basics).
* How to create a [Title Pack](/title-pack), an advanced pack of contents which can include graphics, custom gamemodes, custom weapons, and more, created by the players! See this as an advanced modtool.
