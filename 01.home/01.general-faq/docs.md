## The game said that my key is deactivated or that i'm not authorized to play my Maniaplanet Game
If you have bought one of our games recently through our official retailers Nexway (from official site), the Ubisoft Shop, or Steam, it's probably due to a payment issue, so you have to contact their support on the following pages:

* [Ubisoft Shop](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Games) and search for the related title.

Please note that only authorized retailers will be supported if you have a key issue. Our authorized retailers list includes:

* Ubisoft Store
* Steam
* Nexway
* GamesPlanet

* GreenManGaming

## I forgot my password
If you have forgotten your password, you can only generate a new one via the client in-game. When asked for the password, just click on the button on the login screen. A mail will be sent to the email address linked to your account.

## I forgot my login
You must contact the Ubisoft Support and give them all the relevant information (such as your game key, email address attached to the account, copy of the order, ...) on this page: [https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Games](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Games) and search for your Maniaplanet game.

## I have forgotten or deleted my key, where I can find it?
To recover lost activation keys please contact your retailer.

If you continue to have a problem please contact the Ubisoft support at [http://support.ubi.com](http://support.ubi.com) and submit a question to retrieve your lost activation key. You must include your account details and e-mail address attached to the account.

## I have lost my validation code
You can generate a new validation code through the Player Page here: [https://www.maniaplanet.com/account/validation-code](https://www.maniaplanet.com/account/validation-code)

## I want to redownload the Maniaplanet client
You can redownload the Maniaplanet client at this address: [https://www.maniaplanet.com/download](https://www.maniaplanet.com/download)

## I want to report bad language or bad behavior in the game from a player, how can I do that?
While in game, if you suspect a player of any undesired behavior (cheating, bad language, etc), you can report them easily.

Hold "Tab" to open the player listing and click on the little buddy icon next to their name.

Then, click on report abuse and follow the procedure. The report will go to the server admin who will be able to handle the situation or to us if this is an official server.

We recommend you do not try to communicate with those people in any way to avoid making the situation worse.
You can refer to our charter to know what is considered good or bad: [http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=18072](http://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=18072)

# ShootMania

## What are the official game modes in ShootMania Storm?
There are 8 officials modes developed by Nadeo for ShootMania Storm:

* Melee: Free for All, the player has a certain amount of hits to do to win the map.
* Royal: A survival Free for All, where the aim is to be the last person standing at the end of the round. It’s possible to activate a sphere which will shrink the playing field via a pole which is generally located at the center of the map.
* Battle: It’s a team-based pole capture mode. The goal is to capture the poles of the opponent team or to have the highest capture rate at the end of the timer to win a round.
* Elite: A 3 versus 3 mode. On the field there is an offender equipped with a laser gun (can eliminate an opponent in one hit) with 3 armor points, must survive 45 seconds against 3 defenders equipped with rocket launchers (one armor damage per rocket). Once the time expires, they have 15 seconds to capture the pole or eliminate the 3 defenders (they can also do it in the first 45 seconds) to win the round.
* Joust: 1 versus 1 mode. Players have limited ammunitions. They have to touch one of the poles present in the map to reload their weapons. To win a round, a player must hit their opponent a certain amount of times.
* Combo: A competitive 2 versus 2 mode. Eliminate all your opponents before they have time to respawn. When a player is eliminated, their team will take more time to respawn. Bonus boxes are available on the map to unlock new weapons for the round and reload your armor.
* Warlords: Warlords is a turn-based, top-down view game. Players (2 to 6) control the galaxy. The goal in Warlords is to expand your empire by taking control of planets and making opponents your vassals. Futhermore, each planet provides you with gold which will allow you to conquer planets or protect your own ones.

A number of additional game modes have already been created by the community as well!

## What’s a station?
A station is the place where you can load a Title (like Joust and/or Elite) but can be many things like a graphics mod, a campaign (collection of maps), a minigame created with ManiaScript, and more.

You can unload a station by pressing the “Del” key on a station, but note that you can’t unload a major station like Maniaplanet and ShootMania Storm. The concept of stations is kind of like a DVD drive.

# Demo accounts

## What do I have access to with a Maniaplanet demo account?
Since *Maniaplanet 4* you have access to the ***channels***. A channel is a place containing "programs" created by Ubisoft Nadeo and the community based on Trackmania² or Shootmania Storm. A program can feature a special map playlist, maps with custom items, modded environnements, or even total conversions from the Maniaplanet games. These programs are cycled at fixed times, like a TV show on a TV channel. To find out what is currently live, you can check the schedule pages for [Trackmania](https://www.maniaplanet.com/channels/trackmania) and [Shootmania](https://www.maniaplanet.com/channels/shootmania).

You have no playtime limit when playing on the channels on demo mode, and you have access to all programs of the channels.

## What are the restrictions when playing with a demo account?
With a demo account you have the following limitations:

* No access to the customization menu (which allows you to choose your skin, horn, and nickname).
* No access to the solo campaigns.
* No access to dedicated servers created by the community.
* No access to LAN (local network) servers.
* No access to the local multiplayer menu.
* No access to the editors (Map/Mediatracker/Replay/Painter/Mesh Modeler/etc.)
* No planets are earned. (A free ingame currency which lets you use several Maniaplanet services as well as getting stuff from the community.)

## How can I remove the restrictions?
You can remove the restriction by simply buying a Maniaplanet game to remove most of the restrictions. Note that the restrictions will be removed from the game you have bought, not necessarily platform-wide (especially for the solo campaigns, access to servers, local multiplayer and editors related to the environment bought).
